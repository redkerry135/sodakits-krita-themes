# sodakits-krita-themes

hello and welcome to my little collection of themes for [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) that I made!\
this is still a heavy work in progress, so not much is here at the moment, and colours will be updated frequently

### Installation
1. Download any of the `.colors` files
2. Open Krita, go to Settings -> Manage Resources -> Open Resources Folder
3. Open the `color-schemes` folder
4. Copy and paste the `.colors` files
5. Restart Krita
6. Go to Settings -> Themes to select your desired theme!

### Extra info
My themes are named in a specific format: sodakits Light/Dark [main colour], for example: sodakitsDarkLavender\
The sodakits part is my username and credits\
The Light/Dark part tells whether the theme is light or dark themed\
The main colour is what colour or palette the theme is generally based on

### Screenshots
coming soon!

### Licensing/legal TLDR
You may share and/or modify the themes, but you cannot remove my credits. No liability or warranty is provided
