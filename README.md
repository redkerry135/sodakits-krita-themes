## sodakits-krita-themes

hello and welcome to my little collection of themes for [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) that I made!
this is still a heavy work in progress, so not much is here at the moment.

### Installation
1. Download any of the `.colors` files, or save as .zip to have all of them
2. Open Krita, go to Settings -> Manage Resources -> Open Resources Folder
3. Open the `color-schemes` folder
4. Copy and paste the `.colors` files, or the zip file. Extract the zip file
5. Restart Krita
6. Go to Settings -> Themes to select your desired theme!
   
My themes are named in a specific format: sodakits Light/Dark [main colour]
For example, sodakitsDarkLavender

### Screenshots
coming soon!
